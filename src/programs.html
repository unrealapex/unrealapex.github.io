    <h1>programs i use</h1>
    <article>
      most of the software that i use is free and open source. i do not have much of a problem with proprietary software,
      but when possible i will use open source.

      <h2>the basics</h2>
      <h3>operating system</h3>

      <p>
      i use arch linux as my operating system. i like using arch linux over other linux distributions because it is bleeding
      edge and the convinence of the arch user arch user respository. i initially started out using debian, however, i found
      stable release to be too frustrating.
      </p>

      <h3>terminal emulator and shell</h3>

      <p>
      i use wezterm as my terminal emulator of choice. as for shell, z shell is an improvement over bash. i like its auto
      completion functionality. customizing z shell is less of a pain as well.
      </p>

      <h3>web browser</h3>

      <p>
      i have tried many web browsers. at the moment, i am some what satisfied with firefox. it looks the nicest of all the
      browsers i have used and it is open source. my only complaint with it is that it is slow out of the box. firefox can be
      tweaked to increase performance though with customization of your user.js file. i tweak and harden firefox using <a
        href="https://github.com/yokoffing/betterfox">betterfox</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>text editor</h3>

      <p>
      i do all of my text editing inside of neovim. configured neovim is comparable to ides in terms of their functionality. in neovim i have
      <ol>
        <li>autocompletion</li>
        <li>syntax highlighting</li>
        <li>language server support</li>
        <li>debugging</li>
        <li>linting</li>
      </ol>
      being able to edit text efficently in the terminal is a skill i take for granted.

      <h2>misc stuff</h2>
        <h3>file manager</h3>

      <p>
      fff, simple, gets the job done 
      </p>

      <h3>music</h3>

      <p>
      spotify, i like the music discovery features, mpd/ncmpcpp for everything else
      </p>

      <h3>video</h3>

      <p>
      mpv
      </p>

        <h3>documents</h3>

      <p>
        i usually write documents in markdown and convert them into pdfs using pandoc. i hear it's also useful when working with
        latex files. i view pdfs with zathura.
      </p>

        <h3>images</h3>

      <p>
      i use feh to view images and gimp to edit them.
      </p>

        <h3>email</h3>

      <p>
        i would love to use neomutt, but unfortunately the email service provider i am using at the moment does not support
        other email clients.
